As I selected the second last image and clicked on Set Dimensions of Selected Image the image of that particular is resized to the height and width of the inputs provided

The next can be setting all the images to the size being input or got and it can be done by clicking Set Dimensions for All Images 


[Note]
      The error would be shown as they occur like if we didn't select the image and wanted to get Image Dimensions ,or when height or width are empty
